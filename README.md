## 🚀 Setup & Installation
 
### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Hedgehog or newer
- Android device or emulator (API 24 / Android 7.0+)
- Appwrite account at https://cloud.appwrite.io
 
### Steps
 
1. Clone the repository
 
   git clone https://github.com/Ritesh-Shinde45/HopeConnect.git
 
2. Open in Android Studio
 
3. Set up local configuration
 
   Copy the example file:
   cp local.properties.example local.properties
 
   Fill in your own Appwrite credentials in local.properties:
 
   APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   
   APPWRITE_DB_ID=your_database_id

   APPWRITE_USERS_BUCKET_ID=your_users_bucket_id

   APPWRITE_REPORT_BUCKET_ID=your_report_bucket_id

   APPWRITE_CHAT_BUCKET_ID=your_chat_bucket_id

   ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin_email
 
5. Sync Gradle
   File → Sync Project with Gradle Files
 
6. Run the app
   Hit the ▶ Run button on your connected device or emulator.
 
⚠️ local.properties is gitignored and must never be committed.
   It contains your private backend credentials.

## 🔧 Engineering Challenges & Solutions
 
Appwrite + Java Bridge
The latest Appwrite SDK is Kotlin-first and incompatible with Java out of the box.
Solved this by building a Kotlin-based service layer (AppwriteService.kt + AppwriteHelper.kt)
that bridges async Kotlin coroutines to synchronous Java calls — allowing the existing
Java codebase to consume the backend seamlessly.
 
On-Device ML Performance
Chose MobileFaceNet specifically for its lightweight architecture,
enabling real-time facial embedding comparisons on mid-range Android devices without
noticeable battery drain or lag.
 
Data Integrity & Spam Prevention
Built a complete admin moderation workflow where every report requires approval before
appearing publicly. This keeps the platform reliable and trustworthy for families and authorities.
 
Secrets Management
All backend credentials are loaded at build time via BuildConfig from a local
local.properties file — never hardcoded in source.
Git history was scrubbed clean before open-sourcing.
