# HopeConnect
<<<<<<< HEAD

HopeConnect is an **Android-based social impact application** designed to help locate missing persons and reconnect families using modern technology. The platform enables users to report missing individuals, search for possible matches, and collaborate with the community to increase the chances of recovery.

Many people go missing every year, and traditional investigations can take time. Technology such as **AI-based facial recognition and crowd-sourced reporting** can significantly speed up the process of identifying and locating missing individuals. ([GitHub][1])
